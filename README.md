PROJECT TITLE - PetPal: Streamlined Pet Adoption
DESCRIPTION - PetPal is a local initiative aiming to make pet adoption more accessible. Through our platform, we help connect individuals with pets in need of homes within our community. It's a simple solution fostering meaningful connections between people and pets.

Key Features:
1) User Adoption Experience:
-> Browse and Adopt: Users can easily browse through a diverse range of pets available for adoption, each accompanied by detailed profiles and images.
-> Adoption Requests: Users can submit adoption requests for the pets they are interested in, initiating the adoption process.
2) Admin Control Panel:
-> Add New Pets: Admins have the ability to add new pets to the platform, providing comprehensive information and uploading images to showcase each pet's unique personality.
-> Manage Pet Listings: Admins can update existing pet listings, modifying details such as name, breed, age, type, and adoption status.
-> Remove Pets: Admins have the authority to remove pets from the platform when they find their forever homes or for other administrative reasons.
3) Technological Stack:
-> TypeScript: PetPal is developed using TypeScript, for front end and javascript for fetch api.
-> Nest.js: Our backend is powered by Nest.js, a progressive Node.js framework that promotes modularity and scalability. Nest.js enables us to build structured and maintainable APIs effortlessly.
-> MongoDB: PetPal utilizes MongoDB as the database system, providing a flexible and scalable solution for storing pet data and user information.
We also used it because its JSON-like document model aligns well with modern development practices.
